A fully functional European Roulette game deployed on Netlify with GitHub integration.

## Features
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop.
- Admin panel for deposit, withdrawal, and user management.
- Real-time betting and payout system.
- Data stored locally with `data.js` and managed via Netlify Functions.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` (for Netlify Functions)
3. Deploy to Netlify: Link to GitHub and deploy via Netlify dashboard.

## Deployment
- Push to GitHub.

## Notes
- Uses local storage for simplicity; replace with a persistent solution for production.
- Admin functions are basic and should be secured with authentication in a real app.
